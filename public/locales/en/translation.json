This includes discovery, design, development, testing, and launch. Complex projects like SaaS platforms may take longer, and I’ll provide a detailed timeline upfront."

        "q": "Can I update my website content after it’s built?",

        "q": "What kind of support do you offer post-launch?",

        "q": "Can you build custom features like e-commerce or booking systems?",
        "a": "Yes, I specialize in custom solutions. Whether you need an e-commerce store with payment gateways, a booking system, or a SaaS platform with advanced functionality, I’ll tailor the solution to your needs using modern technologies."
      },
      {
        "q": "Will my website work seamlessly on mobile devices?",
        "a": "Every website I build is fully responsive, ensuring a flawless experience across smartphones, tablets, and desktops. I prioritize mobile-first design and test rigorously to guarantee performance and usability on all devices."

        "a": "To kick things off, share your business goals, any existing content (e.g., text, logos, images), and examples of websites you admire. If you’re unsure, I’ll guide you through a discovery phase to clarify your vision and create a tailored plan."
